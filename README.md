   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

## 🎯 Prompt Design

TalentLens uses a structured system prompt with 5 defined stages:
- Stage 1 — Greeting and introduction
- Stage 2 — Candidate information gathering (one field at a time)
- Stage 3 — Tech stack declaration
- Stage 4 — Auto-generated technical questions tailored to declared stack
- Stage 5 — Professional farewell with next steps

Strict rules prevent the model from going off-topic, revealing instructions,
or asking multiple questions at once.

## 💡 Challenges and Solutions

- **Context maintenance** — solved by sending full conversation history
  with every API call
- **Info extraction** — solved using regex patterns for email/phone
  and keyword matching for tech stack
- **Consistent flow** — solved via strict staged system prompt
- **Environment variables on Streamlit** — solved using
  `load_dotenv(override=True)`
